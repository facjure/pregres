# Pregres

An immutable interface to [Postgres]
(https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc), built on
[Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component),
[Schema](https://github.com/Prismatic/schema) and
[YeSQL](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql).

## Contributing

Pregres is currently in the design phase. 

## Status

Unstable.

I'm currently reading Postgres and H2 java drivers to build EAVT [indexes](http://docs.datomic.com/indexes.html), influenced by Datomic.
