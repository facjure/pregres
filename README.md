# Pregres

An integrated Clojure lib for Postgres, built on [clojure.jdbc](https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc).

## Goals

- Write SQL, avoid ORMs and Clojure DSLs
- Use the [fastest connection pool](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) by default
- Integrate [migrations](https://github.com/weavejester/ragtime)
- Json-friendly serializers, in built
- Query/Finder Apis with YeSQL

## Usage

Coming soon.

## Credits

A big thanks to the teams that created the following libraries. The initial
baseline is being ported from these libraries.
 
- [sparkx-kits](https://github.com/staples-sparx/kits)
- [clj-postgresql](https://github.com/remodoy/clj-postgresql)
- [clojure.jdbc](https://github.com/funcool/clojure.jdbc)
